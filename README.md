# Amazon Connect Contact Lens Rule to MS Teams

The functionality will take a Eventbridge rule, as generated by Contact Lens, parse it and send it on to a MS Teams webhook for review.
This allows a centralized channel view of issues that arise within the Connect platform, whilst not requiring work arounds such as creating dummy users or similar as part of enabling email alerts or any other solution

## Building

1. [Create a new Teams Webhook and store it in SSM Parameter Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet#create-an-incoming-webhook)
2. Run the appropriate `npm` command to generate the code artifact
3. Create the appropriate variable files for Tofu
4. Run your `tofu` `init`, `plan`, and `apply`
5. Validation

## Notes

- Unfortunately the message sent to Eventbridge does not carry a description or similar. This does limit the data available by default to just the Rule Name and Action Name. This could be extended using enhanced lookup features or similar, however this is not currently built in
- Further details like Agent or Queue names could be extracted as seen fit to give more details, but is dependent on the details we would like to see.
- Splitting across multiple channels or groups could be possible. This would likely be via using action names to define destinations
